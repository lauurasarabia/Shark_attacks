It will be followed by the following ranking of points: 

#👨🏻 HEAD = head|skull|throat|face|eyes|ear|neck|cheeks|nose|forehead --> 100 POINTS
#🕺🏻 BODY = body|ribs|heart|back|waist|hips|belly|abdomen|chest --> 50 POINTS
#🦵 🏼LEGS = leg|ankle|groin|thigh|knee|foot|feet|buttocks --> 20 POINTS
#💪🏼 ARMS = arm|hand|finger|elbow|forearm|wrist --> 10 POINTS

But first, we need to clean our database. These are the steps we are going to follow:

 - Export CSV
 - Check columns and rows with complete "NaN" values and remove them
 - Drop all the columns we won't use for our hypothesis
 - Clean column names (removing spaces, special characters, etc.)
 - Clean values by column in order to be able to aggrupate them later
 - Create a ranking of points based on parts of the body (detailed at the previous paragraph)
 
 After this we just have to start analyzing our data. 
 
 Check the "Visualization" notebook to discover who is our winner!!!!!👀
